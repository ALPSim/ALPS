* creation of many-site basis sets with constraints given by quantum numbers
  e.g. total particle number N, spin Sz, ...
  also maybe an XML format for describing these sets?
* better symbolic evaluation, e.g. not evaluate sqrt(2) unless full evaluation
* fermion signs
* splitting of bond-term into site terms for DMRG
