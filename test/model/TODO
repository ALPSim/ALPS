* default parameters for couplings
* creation of many-site basis sets with constraints given by quantum numbers
  e.g. total particle number N, spin Sz, ...
  also maybe an XML format for describing these sets?
* parametrized basis sets, 
  e.g. spin-S with Sz going from -S to S, or softcore bosons with cutoff
* better symbolic evaluation
* fermion signs
