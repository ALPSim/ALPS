# Contributing to ALPS

Thank you for your interest in ALPS (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations).
ALPS is a community-driven, open-source ecosystem for numerical simulations of correlated quantum systems.
Contributions at every level — from a one-line bug report to a new simulation method — are welcome and valued.

## Ways to contribute

Contributions fall into four broad levels. You do not need to start at the bottom — jump in wherever your skills fit.

| Level | What this looks like |
|---|---|
| **1 — Feedback** | Install ALPS, try a tutorial, open an issue when something is unclear or broken |
| **2 — Documentation & tutorials** | Improve or extend tutorials on the [ALPS website](https://alps.comp-phys.org), fix documentation errors, add examples |
| **3 — Maintenance** | Fix bugs, improve tests, update dependencies, respond to community questions on Discord |
| **4 — New code** | Contribute a new algorithm, library, or simulation application |

All contributions require agreeing to release your work under the [MIT License](LICENSE.txt).

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ALPSim/ALPS/issues). Choose the template that best fits:

- **Bug report** — something is broken or produces wrong results
- **Feature request** — you would like new functionality
- **Simulation help** — you need help setting up a specific model, lattice, or method
- **Website help** — problems with the alps.comp-phys.org website

Before opening a new issue, please search existing issues to avoid duplicates.

## Getting started with the code

### Prerequisites

- CMake ≥ 3.18
- A C++17-capable compiler (GCC, Clang, Intel, or Fujitsu)
- Boost (bundled copy included; or provide your own with `-DALPS_USE_SYSTEM_BOOST=ON`)
- For Fortran bindings: gfortran (or compatible Fortran compiler)
- For Python bindings: Python ≥ 3.9, plus `numpy` and `scipy`

See the [installation page](https://alps.comp-phys.org/documentation/install/) for full platform-specific instructions.

### Fork and clone

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ALPS.git
   cd ALPS
   ```
3. Add the upstream remote so you can stay up to date:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ALPSim/ALPS.git
   ```

### Build

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make -j$(nproc)
```

To build with Python bindings:
```bash
pip install scikit-build-core numpy scipy
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```

### Run the tests

From the build directory:
```bash
ctest --output-on-failure
```

All tests must pass before submitting a pull request.

## Making a change

1. **Sync with upstream** before starting work:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout master
   git merge upstream/master
   ```

2. **Create a branch** named after what you are doing:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/alea-overflow
   git checkout -b feature/dmrg-excited-states
   git checkout -b docs/tutorial-heisenberg
   ```

3. **Make your changes.** Keep commits focused and self-contained. Write commit messages in the imperative mood:
   ```
   fix: prevent integer overflow in alea accumulator
   feat: add excited-state targeting to DMRG
   docs: add Heisenberg chain tutorial
   ```

4. **Add or update tests** for any changed behaviour. New simulation methods should include at least one regression test comparing output against a known result.

---

## Submitting a pull request

1. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin fix/alea-overflow
   ```

2. Open a pull request against the `master` branch of `ALPSim/ALPS`.

3. Fill in the pull request template, including:
   - What problem this solves and why
   - How to test the change
   - Any known limitations or follow-up work

4. Ensure CI passes (build + tests on Linux and macOS).

For substantial changes — new simulation applications, new libraries, significant API modifications — we encourage you to **open an issue or start a discussion first** to get early feedback before investing significant time.

---

## Review process

ALPS uses a consensus-based review model:

- Pull requests are reviewed by **maintainers** (at least one per simulation code) and **core maintainers**.
- A pull request is accepted if all active reviewers approve, or if no objections are raised within **six weeks** of submission.
- Controversial changes can be escalated to the [Governing Council](https://alps.comp-phys.org/govern/).

Core maintainers are responsible for validating that code compiles, tests pass, and results are physically correct. Please be responsive to review comments; PRs with no author activity for eight weeks may be closed.

If you are contributing a new simulation application or library, the Governing Council will discuss a maintenance commitment with you — typically a few hours per month for bug fixes, dependency updates, and community support.

## Code style

### C++

- Target C++17.
- Match the style of the surrounding code. ALPS does not enforce a single formatter, but keeps consistent conventions within each subdirectory.
- Avoid undefined behaviour and compiler warnings. New code should compile cleanly with `-Wall -Wextra` on GCC and Clang.
- Prefer standard library and Boost facilities over hand-rolled implementations.

### Python

- Follow [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
- Type annotations are encouraged for new public functions.

### CMake

- CMake ≥ 3.18 features are acceptable.
- Use target-based linking (`target_link_libraries`, `target_include_directories`) rather than directory-level commands.

## Recognition

ALPS releases are accompanied by a publication in a peer-reviewed journal. **Active contributors are added as co-authors.** The Governing Council decides the author list for each release, taking into account contributions to code, documentation, tutorials, testing, and community support.

Contributing documentation, tutorials, or code (Level 2 — improving or extending tutorials and website documentation — or above) with sustained effort is the typical threshold for co-authorship consideration.
