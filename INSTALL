The ALPS library is a C++-library which is based on the BOOST library.
So, if you do not have the latter, you will have to download this
first (installation of the BOOST library is not necessary - ALPS compiles
the parts itself that are actually needed). For more details open
  doc/setup.html
with an HTML browser to check Prerequisites and Installation instructions.
