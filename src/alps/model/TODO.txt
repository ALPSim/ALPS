* adding of quantum numbers
  - make sure that (1-N) + (1-N) gets evaluated to 2-N

* evaluate a sum of QNs on a state

* site basis sets with dependency of min/max of one QN on other QN, e.g. t-J

* basis sets with restriction to specific QNs, e.g. N, Sz

* start with limited basis set, add basis states

* merging of basis sets

* leave sqrt(2) ... symbolic in Expression

* complex (n-site) terms in Hamiltonian

* definition of multi-site operators (e.g. hop()).

* iterator over embeddings of "constraint-graph" of multi-site operator into lattice

* allow complex values in Expression library

* add Nauty interface to BGL

* fermion sign:
  - normal order sort site operators in term by site number
  - determine sign
  
* split multi-site term into site terms

* basis transformation for bond Hamiltonian

* symbolic basis transformation for bond Hamiltonian

* arbitrary multi-site operators for measurements, also useful as base class of Hamiltonian
