* adding of quantum numbers
  - make sure that (1-N) + (1-N) gets evaluated to 2-N (AG)

* evaluate a sum of QNs on a state (MT)

* basis sets with restriction to specific QNs, e.g. N, Sz (AG)

* split multi-site term into site terms (MT)

* sorted basis sets + binary search (MT)


07/03

*regular expressions for wild card in Hamiltonian (ST)


08/03

* multisite (n-site) terms in Hamiltonian (tba)


09/03

* start with limited basis set, add basis states (AG/ST)

* merging of basis sets + subsequent sort (AG/ST)

* iterator over embeddings of "constraint-graph" of multi-site operator into lattice (AG/ST)

* basis transformation for bond Hamiltonian (AG/ST)

* arbitrary multi-site operators for measurements, also useful as base class of Hamiltonian (tba)


* site basis sets with dependency of min/max of one QN on other QN, e.g. t-J


10/03

* definition of multi-site operators (e.g. hop()). (MT)


XX/03

* leave sqrt(2) ... symbolic in Expression (MT)

* allow complex values in Expression library (MT)

* add Nauty interface to BGL (ST)

* fermion sign:
  - normal order sort site operators in term by site number
  - determine sign (AG/ST)
  
* symbolic basis transformation for bond Hamiltonian (tba)
