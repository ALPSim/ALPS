	* [parapack] Now it becomes possible to terminate simulation by
	  making (or touching) an empty file.  For example, if the master
	  XML input filename is "mysim.in.xml", then the termination
	  filename is "mysim.term".

	* [config] Update configure script for Boost verion 1.38.0

2008-11-08  Synge Todo <wistaria@comp-phys.org>

	* [parapack] ALPS/parapack scheduler (version 1.1 2008/11/08) has
	  been merged into ALPS Library.  The ALPS/parapack scheduler supports:

	  - Arbitrary number of clones (or 'runs') can be simulated by
	    specifying NUM_CLONES parameter.  (See e.g.
	    examples/parapack/single/params)

	  - Multiple level parallelization (parallel worker).  (See e.g.
	    examples/parapack/multiple)  The number of processors per clone
            can be specified by --procs-per-clone=X command line option.

	  - Exchange Monte Carlo (or parallel tempering).  (See e.g.
	    examples/parapack/exchange)

	  - Better support for disordered system: parameters WORKER_SEED
	    and DISORDER_SEED will be set automatically from the master
	    seed for each task (SEED).  For parallel workers,
	    WORKER_SEED's are different for each worker (or 'MPI node')
	    but DISORDER_SEED is identical in a clone.
	
	  - Note: The inteface of workers has been changed slightly.
	    Please see sample implementations: examples/parapack/single/ising.h
	    and examples/parapack/multiple/ising.h for serial and parallel
	    workers, respectively.

	  - Note: Since clones in a task will be simulated asynchronously,
	    evaluation of observables (i.e. collecting results of measurement)
	    is NOT performed automatically.  Please use pevaluate tool or
	    rerun application with --evaluate command line option.

          - Note: Since Boost.MPI library is used in ALPS/parapack, Boost 1.35.0
            or higher is required for building ALPS/parapack with MPI support.
