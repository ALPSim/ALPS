        of parameters.

        * [model] Started work on model library

2003-04-16 Synge Todo <wistaria@comp-phys.org>

        investigated.

2003-03-24  Simon Trebst <trebst@comp-phys.org>

        * [palm] Renamed math.h to math.hpp and signal.h to signal.hpp to avoid 
        problems with gcc-3.2.2

          supporting Boost.thread library.  Since it's still experimental,
          and pthread support is currently turned off by default.  For the
          meantime use --with-pthread option to enable pthread support.
          Note that if you enable pthread, you must be sure that

        * [config] Updated documentation.  Information for download,
        configuring, building and installing has been moved into
        doc/setup.html.  Information for compiling user applications is
        also added.  Old files (doc/configure.html and
        doc/palm/configure.html) have been removed.

        * [config] Fixed Makefile.in's.

2003-01-07  Synge Todo <wistaria@comp-phys.org>

        * [osiris] Removed IXDRFileDump::IXDRFileDump(const std::string&)
        and OXDRFileDump::OXDRFileDump(const std::string&), since
        boost::filesystem::path has a constructor, which takes const
        std::string& or const char* as an argument.

2002-12-22  Synge Todo <wistaria@comp-phys.org>

        * [config] Added experimental support for Intel C++ compiler for
        Itanium2 processor (--with-compiler=intel64).

        * [osiris] added support for boost::filesystem to xdrdump.h.
          Removed dump references and supsension/continuing of dumps
          since this is no longer needed for the scheduler.

        * [alea] all file paths now given as boost::filesystem::path

        * [scheduler] changed to post-review version of boost::filesystem
          all file paths now given as boost::filesystem::path
 
2002-11-25  Matthias Troyer <troyer@comp-phys.org>

        * [scheduler] Added load() function and removed constructor from IDump
          to simplify examples. Added a second Ising example using the lattice
          library. Documentation not yet up-to-date.

        * [lattice] Made default graph type coordinate_lattice_graph easier

        * [scheduler] Added an example using the lattice factory

        * [palm] Added seed_with_sequence function to seed any random
          number generator with an integer seed, employing palm::pseudo_des
          to generate seed blocks.

2002-11-8  Matthias Troyer <troyer@comp-phys.org>

        * [scheduler] Wrote documentation for scheduler and simplified
          the interface. The most important changes are that the save()
          function should not call the base class version now, and that
          random() refers to the generator, which is now not necessarily
          a floating point one. random_01(), going with the boost convention,
          now gives random numbers in the interval [0,1). Also, a default
          templated factory has been added.

2002-10-31  Synge Todo  <wistaria@comp-phys.org>

        * [config] Fixed ac_palm_pvm.m4 for SGI.

2002-10-24  Matthias Troyer <troyer@comp-phys.org>

        src/alea/simpleobservable.h.

        * [palm] Replaced function template palm::StringValue::operator
        T() by explicit conversion functions (operator int(), operator
        double(), etc) for GCC 3.1.1 and MIPSpro Compiler.

2002-10-24  Matthias Troyer <troyer@comp-phys.org>

        * [palm] Removed file system functions, have been replaced by

        * [lattice] Inserted dummy function call to prevent optimizer bug
        with gcc-3

        * [scheduler] Major changes, changed to XML file format and abstracted
        from pure Monte Carlo scheduler. Documentation remains to be written
        as well as better archiving tools. Currently not all of the information
        recorded in alea observables is written in XML.

2002-10-23  Synge Todo  <wistaria@comp-phys.org>

        * [config] Reconstructed Makefile structure, so that MPI and PVM
        versions of example files are built as well as single version.

        * [boost] Added new directory src/boost, in which Boost object
        library (currently Boost::filesystem library) will be build.

        * [config] Removed macro PALM_HAVE_XML_PARSER, OSIRIS_MPI,
        OSIRIS_PVM, ALEA_WITH_OSIRIS_DUMPS, etc, and replaced with
        PALM_WITHOUT_XML, PALM_MPI, PALM_PVM, PALM_WITHOUT_OSIRIS, etc,
        respectively.  Removed src/alea/config.h.in

        * [config] Removed config/boost directry from distribution and
        changed configure script so that configure script in boost source
        tree will be used instead if --enable-boost-config option is
        specified.

2002-10-16  Synge Todo  <wistaria@comp-phys.org>

        * [lattice] Fixed functions and traits classes, so that
        adjacency_list class with template parameter EdgeListS=vecS is
        handled properly as coordinate_graph_type (EdgeListS=listS).

        * [lattice] Added example program demonstrating usage of parity.

2002-10-11  Synge Todo  <wistaria@comp-phys.org>

        * [xml] Added new XML parser, which uses Xerces C++, Expat, or
        native PALM++ XML parser, and handler classes for parameters.

2002-10-10  Synge Todo  <wistaria@comp-phys.org>

        * [xml] Fixed src/xml/xml.C.

        * [lattice,scheduler] Replaced all palm::get<T> by static_cast<T>
        in src/lattice/latticedescriptor.h, src/lattice/vectorio.h,
        src/scheduler/MCRun.C, and src/scheduler/MCSimulation.C.

        * [config] Added Makefile.dep files in each directory and
        config/makedepend.pl script, which helps to generates
        Makefile.dep's.  Added config/rules.mk and config/rules-lib.mk,
        and adopted Makefile.in's to use them.  Added new entries:
        examples, tests, and depend in top Makefile.

2002-10-09  Matthias troyer <troyer@comp-phys.org>

        * [config] Fixed config/ac_palm_mpi.m4 for Darwin (Mac OS X)

         * [doc] Updated documentation of the libraries.
        Documentation of the configuration and installation is
        still missing

        * [palm] removed palm::get function since static_cast does the same
