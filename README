ALPS++ Project

The ALPS++ project (Algorithms and Libraries for Physics Simulations)
aims at providing generic parallel algorithms for classical and
quantum lattice models and provides utility classes and algorithm for
many other problems. It strives to increase software reuse in the
physics community.  See doc/index.html for more details.
