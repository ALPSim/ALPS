Query 1: We would prefer to keep the old wording, since we refer to the same state given at different times.

Query 6: Please change to: 'One can also deplete the lattice by removing a fraction of sites or bonds randomly from a lattice.'

Ref 69: The complete reference is IEEE Visualization 2005, Proceedings, p. 135-142.

Additional changes:

Please remove the dots in the verbatim commands in Section C.3, as these are commands that have to be typed in literally and the additional dot will most likely create confusion.

We suggest to add more keywords for the paper:
* Classical Monte Carlo simulations
* Quantum Monte Carlo simulations
* Quantum Phase Transitions (Theory)

As explained already in the submission, we include the VisTrails workflow files that were used to create the figures with the manuscript, and intend to place links to these files either in the figure directly or in the caption of the figure. This was already done in our initial submission, where links were placed pointing to ancillary files from arxiv.org. These should be replaced by links to the auxiliary files at their final location on the servers of IOP.

Also, we would like to update the source code of ALPS, which will be included as auxiliary file with this publication, to contain the final reference to the paper. Is it possible to obtain this reference before the paper is published in a final version?

Please send us a second set of proofs in order to make sure all the changes have been done correctly.
