<title> SSE2 code</title>
</head>
<body>
This is the SSE2 code by Norbert Stoop. It has been developed from the SSE code in sse (dirloop_sse) as part of a diploma thesis in summer 2006 in the group of M. Troyer.<p>

This code implements the wang landau sampling as well as optimized ensemble sampling. The code is not in a state where it can be used without care. So... know what you're doing or use the qwl or the sse code!<br>

By default this code is not being built, and it is not part of the alps applications.
