* How to make a snapshot?

1) Just type `make snapshot' in directory `dist', which generates the
snapshot of the current CVS repository.  The file name is
dist/alps-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz, where YYYY = year, MM = month, and DD =
day.


* How to update preamble of files?

1) Edit preamble.in.  Note that keywords @COPYRIGHT@ and @ID@ will be
   replaced by appropriate strings.

2) Type make update-preamble in 'dist' directory.


* How to release a new version and prepare the distribution file?

1) Edit line 11 of configure.in.  ex)

     AC_INIT([alps],[1.5]

   The second argument to AC_INIT should be a correct version number.

2) Regenerate configure script by typing

     ./bootstrap

   at the top-level source directory.

3) Check documentations and ChangeLog file once again.

4) Check whether all the files and directories you do NOT want
   distribute are listed in ERASE in dist/Makefile.in.

5) ./configure && make depend && make all

6) cvs commit

7) (cd dist && make check)

   Check dist/alps-*.tar.gz

8) cvs tag release_X_X_X

   ex) for version 2.0    ->  use tag release_2_0
       for version 2.3b1  ->  use tag release_2_3b1

9) (./configure && cd dist && make release) generates

   alps-X.X.tar.gz, where X.X = verison number

10) make boost-snapshot boost-sandbox-snapshot

    If the release is not based on an official Boost release make a Boost
    snapshot.

11) Copy the tar ball to the web server and update web page.
